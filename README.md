Ever needed a graceful way to say “no”?  
This tiny API returns random, generic, creative, and sometimes hilarious rejection reasons — perfectly suited for any scenario: personal, professional, student life, dev life, or just because.

Built for humans, excuses, and humor.

This `main` serves as a reference to different implementations of "No as a Service" (NaaS) in various programming languages. Each language implementation is maintained on its own branch at `pl/<lang>`.
